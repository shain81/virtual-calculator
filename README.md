# 🖥️ Virtual Calculator using OpenCV  

🚀 **A touchless, AI-powered calculator using hand gestures!**  

This project transforms hand movements into mathematical inputs using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, allowing users to interact with a virtual calculator **without touching a keyboard**.  

## 🔹 Features  
✔️ **Real-time hand tracking** with OpenCV & MediaPipe  
✔️ **Gesture-based input** for mathematical operations  
✔️ **Click detection** – closing two predefined fingers acts as a click 🖱️  
✔️ **Left & right hand recognition** for accurate tracking  
✔️ **Smooth & responsive UI** with optimized performance  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **OpenCV** – Computer vision processing  
- **MediaPipe** – Hand tracking & gesture detection  
- **Python & NumPy** – Core logic & calculations  

## 📌 Usage  
Simply run the script, show your hand to the camera, and start performing calculations with gestures!
